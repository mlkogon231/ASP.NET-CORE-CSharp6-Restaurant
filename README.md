As I am learning ASP.NET CORE and C# 6 features, I am building this Restaurant Example.

The application is a working web/database application for storing Restaurant Information, built using ASP.NET CORE 2.1 and Visual 
Studio 2017 Community Edition, from a tutorial by Scott Allen on pluralsight.com

Added Entity Framework Migration Code to Application - 09/05/2018
Added Identity Framework/Authentication and 
  Basic Bootstrap - 09/14/2018

NOTE: The Application should be considered Proof of Concept and In Progress - 09/14/2018
